      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p>
        An upcoming graduate of the University of Denver Coding Bootcamp, I'm
        excited to re- enter the workforce as a software engineer. Learning to
        code has been the hardest yet most rewarding skill I have ever studied.
        The continual cycle of growth required for this industry excites the
        learner in me. This trait has made me a professional who is eager and
        ready to transition from my previous roles.
